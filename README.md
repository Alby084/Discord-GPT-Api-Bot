# How to input your bots token

Create an ".env" file in the bots root folder and format the ".env" as follows.\
Replace "TOKEN_HERE" with your bots token but keep the double quotation marks. e.g. BOT_TOKEN = "123456789".\
The .gitignore will ignore this file.

```
BOT_TOKEN = "TOKEN_HERE"
```

If you want to change the ".env" file location you will need to update the reference for it in main.py
